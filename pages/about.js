          <p>
            I've 19 years old and live in the city of Pouso Alegre, in the state
            of Minas Gerais, in the country Brazil. Iâ€™m a Self-taught Developer,
            which means that I have no degree and learn everything by myself,
            And have much confidence in what I apply to my projects, I speak
            English very well which helps me a lot, and am not a good designer
            but enjoy it. I like to write, not just codes, and enjoy solving
            problems and refactoring old projects.
